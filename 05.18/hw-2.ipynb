    "2. Experiment with simple packet assignment policies (round-robin, least-loaded servers first, ...) as well as with policies that consider the occupancy of the queue of the servers (e.g., avoid sending packets to servers that have a full queue, or to a queue that is more than $x\\%$ full, for some $x$).\n",

    "3. For each policy, plot a histogram showing the number of packets served by each of the $c$ servers, as well as the average distribution of the queuing delay experienced by each packet. You can show other metrics as needed."
